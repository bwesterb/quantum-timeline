Global Risk Instutute Quantum Risk Timeline over the years
==========================================================

Each year since 2019 the Global Risk Institute performs a survey
amongst experts how likely it is RSA-2048 will be broken on 5, 10,
15, 20, and 30 year timelines.

This repo contains some graphs on how these predictions evolved over
the year.
